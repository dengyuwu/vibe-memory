Use this repository as a one-sentence install target for development memory workflow.

Installation contract:
1. Read `bootstrap/manifest.json`.
2. Detect the active tool:
   - Prefer `--tool codex` when the user explicitly asks for Codex only.
   - Prefer `--tool claude` when the user explicitly asks for Claude Code only.
   - Prefer `--tool both` when the user explicitly asks for both.
   - Otherwise let the installer auto-detect by omitting `--tool`.
3. Run `node ./skills/dev-memory-protocol/scripts/install.mjs --project <target-project>`.
4. Append the managed rule block only. Never overwrite existing rules outside the managed block.
5. Initialize `.ai/` files if missing. Do not delete user-authored memory files.
6. Prefer wiring hooks so memory read, recall, candidate capture, and indexing run automatically after installation.
7. Report which files were created or updated.
8. If the user wants auto-bootstrap across future Codex project conversations, tell them to enable the skill-managed global bootstrap with `install-global.mjs`.

Supported environment:
- Windows and macOS
- Node.js 18 or newer
- Codex and Claude Code

User-facing one-line prompt:
`帮我从这个仓库安装 dev-memory-protocol：https://github.com/dengyuwu/dev-memory-protocol-skill`

Auto-detect behavior:
- If only `AGENTS.md` exists, install for Codex.
- If only `CLAUDE.md` exists, install for Claude Code.
- If both exist, install for both.
- If neither exists, install for both so future sessions on either tool can use the protocol.
